# :rocket: GoStack Bootcamp

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: About

Here you can find everything I coded along the classes of the GoStack Bootcamp, by @Rocketseat.

The organization is optimized to facilitate per section consultation, so you can find some duplicated code in cases where a section is based on another.

Currently uploading the challenges made in the bootcamp in different repositories.
